#
# Switch configuration
#
# There are two switches: master (switch0) and slave (switch1).
#
# Ports P0 and P5 of the master switch are connected to the CPU ports
# ETH1 and ETH2, respectively. ETH1 shall be used for LAN and ETH2 for WAN.
#
# Port P3 of the master switch is the WAN port. VLAN2 is set up
# to isolate P3 and P5 of the master switch from LAN ports of
# both the master and the slave switch.
#
# All ports of the master switch except P3 and P5 are assigned to VLAN1.
#
# All ports of the slave switch are assigned to VLAN1. Port P6 of the slave
# switch is unused and idle.
